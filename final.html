    <h1>MUSIC is divine</h1><br>
   What is the cut-off for being a “young composer”? Everyone defines that line a little differently, but I’m in my mid-30s, and in my case anyway, I certainly feel like I’ve moved onto the next thing.

This transition is more a state of mind than anything else. Over the past few years, when I’ve found myself in young composer settings, I’ve gotten that awkward feeling of being somewhere you no longer belong, like when you visit your old high school a few years into college.

Also, much to my amazement, I’ve found myself confronted on occasion by composers younger than me asking for career advice.<br><br>
<h1>Red Shift 15th anniversary sampler</h1><br>
Redshift Music put out a compilation sampler for their 15th anniversary, celebrating some of their favourite recordings, including a piece by me!

They selected my Who Made the Inch of Grass, commissioned and recorded by Corey Hamm and Nicole Lee. Check out the sampler, which is available from Redshift or on BandCamp.<br><br>
<h1>Interests of young generation</h1><br>
The predominant ideology in composition today, across all genres, is rooted in pastiche. Most composers in the new music community aren’t consciously thinking about this, but we’re involved all the same. I mean, just look at the names: new complexity, neo-romanticism, post-minimalism—three of the broadest trends in contemporary music, all with echoes of pastiche baked right into their labels. Of course not everyone is writing “in the style of” or explicitly quoting other pieces, but the desire to build perceptible bridges between musical traditions is nearly universal.<br><br><br>
